 Team Retrospective Analysis
1. Technical Challenge Encountered

The most significant technical challenge our team faced during the collaborative workflow was learning to effectively use GitHub for version control and teamwork. At the beginning, several members were unfamiliar with concepts such as branching, committing, and creating pull requests. As a result, some changes were pushed before pulling the latest version, leading to small synchronization issues and minor merge conflicts. Although these incidents were not severe, they slowed down our progress and caused some confusion. Through active communication, screen-sharing sessions, and mutual support, we gradually improved our understanding of GitHubâ€™s workflow. By the end of the project, we had developed a much stronger grasp of how to manage branches, pull updates frequently, and coordinate commits to prevent future conflicts.

2. Merge Conflict and Resolution Process

A merge conflict occurred in index.html when several team members added their profile links simultaneously inside the team section. Git couldnâ€™t automatically merge changes because multiple edits were made to the same <div class="team-container"> area. To resolve it, we pulled the latest version, opened the file, and located the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>). We compared both versions, kept all the valid <a href="...">View Profile</a> links, and removed the markers. After confirming that every team memberâ€™s profile appeared correctly.

 The final page now displays all member cards with working profile links.

3. Pull Request and Peer Review Evaluation

The pull request and peer review process was highly effective in enhancing the overall quality of our final website. Requiring at least one team member to review each pull request helped identify and correct minor issues such as missing tags, layout inconsistencies, and formatting problems before merging. This process also encouraged clear communication, better documentation, and accountability within the team. It created an environment where members could learn from each other and maintain consistent coding standards. In future projects, we plan to introduce short review checklists and automated HTML/CSS linters to further streamline the review process and maintain code quality.
